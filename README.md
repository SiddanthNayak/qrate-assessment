## What to do?

LearnBuddy, an E-learning platform containing several courses, each course can have "N" number of lessons, each lesson will contain a video and after the user watched the video there will be some question. If the user successfully completes all the questions, user will move them to the next lesson, otherwise they have to restart the current lesson.

Create a web application using React.js or Next.js for the above. The application must contain 2 pages, one to list down all the lessons and another page for the user to take a lesson (video and the quiz).

For data, create a json file containing all the data and iterate over it, like you would do with an api response.

## Bonus Points:

Store the candidates progress for each lesson inside the local storage, so that we can show completion stats to the candidate in the UI and also the candidate would be able to restart the lesson from where they have left.
